This was part of a summer project with 4 of my friends, to create a working self driving, small RC car from scratch.
I worked on the steering portion of the car, where I utilized PyTorch to implement a convolutional neural network, and trained the car
with 3000 different images, achieving a 98% accuracy at detecting which way to steer. This code was combined with code from my friend
who created the logic for how the car moves, to allow the car to drive by itself.
